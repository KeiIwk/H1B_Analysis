# H1B Visa Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing H1B visa application data from October 1, 2021, to June 30, 2022. The dataset contains approximately 500,000 records and 96 columns, and the analysis aims to provide insights for international students seeking H1B visa sponsorship in the U.S.

## Objectives
1. **Database Setup**  
   - Upload raw data to a SQL Server database.  
   - Create a cloud-based SQL database for processing and grant access to the professor for review.

2. **Data Processing**  
   - Use MySQL commands (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) for data transformation to make the dataset suitable for analysis.

## Key Insights
- **Lottery System**: The H1B visa process is highly competitive, with no guarantee of approval. Students should plan for at least a one-year waiting period.
- **Top Employers**: Amazon stands out as a top employer offering diverse job opportunities and competitive salaries.
- **Regional Insights**: Boston, Massachusetts, is a prime location for computational and mathematical occupations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **SQL Server**: For database setup and querying.
- **MySQL Commands**: For data transformations and cleaning.
